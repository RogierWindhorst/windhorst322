Here we suggest a problem set based on term project 4) in the Syllabus,
which is based on the Windhorst et al. 2018 JWST caustic transit
paper. 

The astrophysics covered in this paper is so wide, that it lends itself
well for focused questions the interns can be challenged to address
with a view towards JWST, e.g.:

1) Calculate from the data (Madau diagram, CIB power spectrum) given or
discussed from references that the SB from Pop III objects at z>7 is
fainter than >31 mag/arcsec^2 in K-band for both stars and stellar mass
black hole accretion disks.

2) Use simple zero metallicity Planck curves to write a computer program
to simulate the spectra of Pop III stars and stellar mass BH accretion
disks as a function of Temperature and redshift. For stellar mass BH
accretion accretion disks, these need to be made radius dependent using
the simple multi-color accretion disk model. What do you conclude
about the fluxes seen at z>7 in the JWST filters from these objects?.
Can you extrapolate this to mini galaxies consisting of Pop III stars
and supermassive BH accretion disks at z>7?

3) Use the simple stellar evolution models given in the Tables for
Fe/H=0 to confirm the brightness of individual stars or BH accretion
disk at z>7 for JWST. This include distance modulus, K-correction,
bolometric corrections, etc. What do you conclude about JWST observing
them?.

4) What gravitational lensing properties do you need to make these
individual Pop III stars or stellar mass accretion disks temporarily
visible to JWST?. Discuss the lateral cluster velocities, JWST
observing time scales, and lensing magnifications needed to make these
objects temporarily visible to JWST, using the equations in section
4--5 and the Appendix A. How would you design a JWST observing program
to find these Pop III stars and BH accretion disks at z>7? [Extra
credit for finding the typo in one of the equations in section 4.4].

5) Can you run existing cluster gravitational lensing models to produce
lensing maps as in Fig. 4ab. Can you confirm that given the angular
size of the stars and BH accretion disks at z>7 lensing magnifications
of 10^4-10^5 are possible and needed. Discuss complications you may run
into with JWST.

6) Can you use existing (HST or JWST) image simulation software to
simulate what a cluster image of JWST would look like at 1--5 micron?
Can you then add a single star or stellar mass BH accretion disk at
z=10, and push it across the caustic, to make it visible in the image.
[This one is not for the timid, but could lead to a PASP paper!].

One could even think about a group project, where all topics get
covered, but any of the students works on 1-2 of these aspects.

We can discuss by phone how to best proceed, and have some Zoom mtgs
with the students if needed (during fixed time slots of the week).
