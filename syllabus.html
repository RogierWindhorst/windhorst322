AST 322 -- Syllabus and Course Rules - Spring 2025

</B></font></font></font></h2>

<P> <font color="#000000">

<P>

<P>

<B>Course description: </B>

The AST 322 students will be taught the highlights of modern Lambda-CDM (Cold
Dark Matter) cosmology, starting with the basics of Special and General
Relativity. The second part of the course will focus more on the main
observations that have led to modern Lambda-CDM cosmology. The course will be
general enough to be of interest and use to students in astrophysics, 
aerospace and mechanical engineering, mathematics and computer science, 
physics, space exploration, and related fields. 

<P>

<B>Learning outcomes: </B>

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to derive and
solve the Friedmann equations for relativistically expanding universes, and be
able to digest modern observational papers on Lambda-CDM cosmology, including
writing a meaningful term project on a topic of their choice in this field.
This will prepare them for research in astrophysics and cosmology, as well
applying the basic laws of physics and relativity to real-world situations. 

<P>

<B>Prerequisites: </B> Basic physics and math at the 200 level. For the term 
project due Tu April 24-27, 2025, you may need some basic plotting skills (e.g.,
MATLAB, Python, or any other common plotting package). For a few homework
questions, you will need to know how to solve a simple differential equation
--- if you have not already covered this in a previous course, the TAs will
setup a tutorial session to help you do this. I will try to limit the math on
GR in the first part of the course (Jan-Mar), or we'll never get to the
important parts on observational cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution. I
designed AST 322 so that you can follow it without yet having done all the
other extragalactic AST 300 or 400-level courses, although astrophysics
students will need to take these in the future if you haven't already done so.

a complete grasp of the subject, so there is <I>no</I> good modern textbook on
cosmology. I spent quite some time to find textbooks on (observational)
cosmology that are acceptable, and came up with the following:

<P>

<B>WARNING: </B> Most of modern theoretical cosmology was developed from
1910-today (with the main analytical framework in place by 1965) and most of
observational cosmology from 1960-today. Hence, my most important message to
you is that Cosmology is NOT a point-and-click science, so there is remarkably
little about cosmology you can learn and fully understand from the WWW if you
haven't first properly digested a complete textbook on cosmology. So please do
NOT focus the study for this class on the Web -- you will get lost and miss the
essentials. You will notice quickly that it is far more important for this
class to have understood a given problem, than to come up with Web-material
that does little to enhance your understanding of the problem. The only time
that Web-use is essential or appropriate is when you prepare for the term
project and retrieve modern papers on the subject.

<P>

<B>(1) ``Introduction to Cosmology, 2nd Edition'', by Barbara Ryden </B>
[hereafter abbreviated as Ry], 2017, Cambridge University Press (UK), York),
ISBN: 978-1-107-15483-4, hardback, costs about $ 44-58 to buy, or $ 23-43 to
rent (the price range indicates used-new; NOTE: The ASU Bookstore now stores 
books alphabetically by author's last name, so find Ryden's book in the
R-section, not the AST section!). This book is mandatory to buy for this class,
and we will follow it closely. Do NOT buy the 1st edition from 2003, as it is
no longer up-to-date. Ryden's 2nd Edition is a fully updated, new book (as of
late fall 2016) with an excellent up-to-date discussion of modern cosmology
including the basic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker frame-work. However, it does not
address all relevant aspects of observational cosmology, which is why I suggest
that we may use Longair's book as complementary source of material. The
important parts to fetch from Ryden's book are chapter 3-10, which provide a
more modern framework of Lambda-dominated and equation-of-state cosmologies. If
you take this course for a grade, you need to get and read Ryden's book: 

<P>

<P>

<B>E-book version of the text-book:</B> A Kindle Edition
of the textbook can be rented for about $ 30. Open new browser window for: <a
href=" http://www.amazon.com "> http://www.amazon.com </a>. Then in the Amazon
search window, enter: `` Barbara Ryden Introduction to Cosmology Ebook ''. 

<P>

<B>Lecture notes and voluntary reading:</B> Click on the Scripts button for
(PDF or PPT) slides of all figures in the text book, and notes on all chapters
in the textbook. You are strongly advised to <I>make your own notes</I>.

<P>

<P>
Other books on Cosmology that are useful, but by no means complete, nor
up-to-date, nor unbiased, are listed below. These are NOT mandatory, but will
used occasionally as reference during the semester. Where necessary, the TA
will provide you with copies of a few of the relevant pages:

<P>

<P>
<B>(2) ``Galaxy Formation'', by Malcolm S. Longair </B> [hereafter abbreviated
as ML] 1998, Springer Verlag (Berlin), ISBN=3-540-63785-0, hardcover costs
about $ 90. This book is optional, and only suggested for those who intend to
become astronomy PhD graduate students some day. Longair's book is a
remarkably good book that strikes an appropriate balance between modern
theories and modern observations, without getting lost in unnecessary details.
It is about the best relatively modern book available that lays the foundations
for observational cosmology. Written by one of the most gifted observational
astronomers in the UK. Since it came out in late 1998, Longair's book mostly
discusses the classical <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
SRC="img12.png" ALT="$\Lambda$">=0 Friedmann models, and doesn't deal with the
latest Lambda-dominated and equation-of-state cosmologies, which is why we will
mostly lean on book (1). Longair's book does cover other topics in better
detail, such as gravitational lensing. Where needed, I will use some charts from
other books in class. 

<P>

<P>

<B>Schedule:</B> An outline for AST 322 is given in the attached Schedule. We
will follow this schedule in principle, but changes may be announced later.

<P>

<B>Interaction:</B> Despite the fact that this lecture and Zoom room might be
intimidating, I invite you to ask questions about the material. I like to have
interaction with the class, and will give plenty opportunity to ask questions.
The first few minutes after class starts will be set aside for questions in
particular. <I>The 15 min immediately before class are strictly off-limits for
questions, since I need this time to setup and store away the
audiovisuals.</I> Our office hours are available if you need individual help.
Please feel free to raise your (Zoom) hand during class-time if you have a
question, and when I call your question, please speak up loudly, so that
everyone can hear it (i.e., unmute yourself in Zoom when you need to speak,
but mute at all other times). 

<P>

<B>Weekly Homework (H/W):</B> There will be a few weekly homework problems, due
every Thursday at the start of class. Submit a copy of your homework as PDF 
file only via Canvas, and provide a printed paper copy to the TAs (after 
Thursday's class time). We do not accept MS doc(x) files. The TAs will have each
homework set graded by the next Tuesday, and we may briefly discuss them at
the start of next Tuesday's class. Hence, no late H/W will be accepted after
the solutions have been discussed. Only in some cases will extensions be
granted, and in such cases, the student must email the TAs at least 48 hours
before the homework is due. If no extension is given, homework received after
the deadline (but before solutions are discussed) will receive only half credit.

<P>

<B>Term Project:</B> There will also be a Term Project, which will entail
writing a 10 page ApJ Letter style paper on a cosmology subject of your choice, and
which will be due the week before finals week. All of this must be your own
work, although you should consult the literature, and may discuss it with
others. To clarify, you could do a join Term Project developing a database or
code together, as long as you list your team-mates as co-authors or
collaborators on your own Term Project paper and describe what everyone did. 
But writing your own Term Project paper must be entirely your own work. Copying
from others or from (poor!) Web-sources is not allowed (see ASU rules on
plagiarism below) -- we want to grade you on how well you understand the
material, not how well you can copy. The rubric for the sections your 10-page
term paper should contain is listed <a href="
ast322s19_RubricforTermPaperRequirement.pdf"> here</a> (an Appendix is
optional for supplemental materials). We are open to other suggestions as to how
you want to be tested on the subject. As this is a fairly new undergraduate
course under development in a rapidly evolving field, we particularly covet your
feedback at the beginning of the semester, and throughout, as to what can be
done better.

<P>

<B>Honor's Project credit:</B>Honor's Projects may be done for Honor's credit
based on Ryden Figure 5.6: choose about 20-25 different (Omega_M, Omega_Lambda) 
values, as indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 5.6, and solve the Friedmann
equation (Eq. 5.81) by numerically solving Eq. 5.83 for each of the 20-25
different cases. Plot a(t) for each universe as in Ryden Fig. 5.7 (make up to
20-25 of these plots) showing that each universe can exist as a valid solution
of the the Friedmann equation. Make sure your models cover all the relevant
parameter space as in Ryden Fig. 5.6-5.7. Then summarize your result in a <10
page paper including figures. All Honor's credit Email correspondence should go
directly to the UG TA Jakob Perivolotis <a 
href="mailto:jperivol@asu.edu">jperivol@asu.edu</a>. They can sign the Honor's 
contracts on my behalf.

6) Mystery topic: To be discussed first day of classes.

<P>

<B>Final Exam:</B> There will not be a final exam nor a midterm. 

<P>

<B>Grading policies and percentages: </B> Your final grade will be determined
from your class attendance, the 8 H/W sets and the semester term-project. No
make-up H/W sets will be given after previous H/W has been returned. Class
attendance will be kept through a twice-weekly attendance sheet that you must
sign before leaving the class period.

<P>

The total possible maximum score is 240 points: a maximum of 20 points for
each of the 8 H/W sets for a total of 160 H/W points and 80 points for the
term project, For upper division undergraduate courses, the grades are likely
not on a strong curve, but closer to a straight scale, which includes A+, A,
A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D, and E. From past experience, if you do your best on
all the homework and the term project, most students will end up with A-B
grades. The A+ grade reflects excellent work and active class participation.

<P>

<B>Extra Credit Points:</B> A maximum number of 20 total <I>extra credit</I>
points may be obtained during the semester. Therefore, you may earn up to a
maximum of 260 points in this course. 10 of these points will be dependent upon
class attendance and the other 10 will be dependent upon in-class participation
(answering or proposing great questions) and a few extra credit homework
problems. The TAs will log this extra credit during class time. Make sure you
contact the TAs right after class if extra credit for an excellent question or
answer was awarded. The best thing you can do for your grade is regular class
attendance and active participation in class.

<P>

<B> AST Grades will be available on Canvas, see: </font></B> 
<a href="
http://students.asu.edu/student-records-grades
">
http://students.asu.edu/student-records-grades
</a> </font>

<P>

<B>Due Dates:</B> To avoid overloading The TAs and myself in the grading of all
materials at the end of the semester, all due dates listed in the syllabus will
be strictly enforced. The TAs will reward early submissions with early-bird
extra credit, and will take points off for late submissions, if these even can
still be accepted. 

<P>

<B>Web-pages relevant to AST 322:</B> Since a stunning number of NASA images
relevant to AST 322 have become available in recent years, I will continue to
teach with the large-screen connected to a PC to show some of the best images.
Click on the ``Links'' button to see some of the Web-pages relevant to AST 322. 

<P> 

<B>ASU requires us to list the following ASU policies on our syllabi (revised 
01/24)</B> 

<P> 

<B>Accommodation for Religious Practices:</B> 
The university community should, in all its activities, be sensitive to the
religious practices of the various religious faiths represented in its student
body and employees. Faculty are asked to recognize the obligations of their
students who may be participating in the observance of religious holidays.
Students should notify faculty at the beginning of the semester about the need
to be absent from class due to religious observances. For more information,
visit 
<a href="
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-04.html ">
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-04.html </a>

<P> 

<B>Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities:</B>
Students who participate in university-sanctioned activities that require
classes to be missed, shall be given opportunities to make up examinations and
other graded in-class work. Normally, the made-up work will be due on the class
day immediately after the absence. Absence from class or examinations due to
university-sanctioned activities does not relieve students from responsibility
for any part of the course work required during the period of the absence. For
more information, visit 
<a href="
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html ">
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-02.html </a>

<P>

<B>Accommodating students with disabilities:</B> 
Students who feel they will need disability accommodations in this class but
have not registered with the Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning
Services office should contact SAILS immediately. The SAILS Tempe office is
located on the first floor of the Matthews Center Building. SAILS staff
can also be reached at (480) 965-1234 (V) or (480) 965-9000 (TTY). For
additional information, visit: 
<a href="
https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility ">
https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility </a>

<P> 

<B>Academic Integrity and Anti-Plagiarism Policy:</B> 
Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, and
laboratory work, academic transactions and records. The possible sanctions
include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, course failure
(indicated on the transcript as a grade of E), course failure due to academic
dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a grade of XE), loss of registration
privileges, disqualification and dismissal. For more information, see
<a href="
http://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity ">
http://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity </a>

<P> 

Plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Students must take the exams
independently without assistance from other students. Students may not submit
papers written by persons other than themselves. Students must submit original
work for this course and may not submit papers previously submitted to (an)
other class (es). The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in
detail. These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: (1) Cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment; (2)
Plagiarizing; (3) Academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information; (4)
Aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately collaborating;
(5) Falsifying academic records. See 
<a href="
https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity ">
https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity </a>

<P> 

In practice, this means that you are <I>not</I> allowed to hand in the same
H/W or Term Project paper as your class mates. Your homework and term project
will be checked for copying from the internet. Doing so, or copying from
neighbors, allowing others to copy, will all be considered cheating and result
in an EX <I>for the course</I>. No exceptions. Morale of the story is that
cheating and plagiarism are not worth it, and about as dangerous for your
career as falling into a black-hole: <a href="https://makeagif.com/i/fi2vzJ
">https://makeagif.com/i/fi2vzJ</a> !

<P> 

<B>Copyright:</B> 
Students must refrain from uploading to any course shell, discussion board, or
website used by the course instructor or other course forum, material that is
not the student's original work, unless the students first comply with all
applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve the right to delete
materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement. For more
information, see the Computer, Internet, & Electronic Communications Policy at
<a href="
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html ">
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html </a>

<P>

<B>Recorded materials:</B> The contents of this course, including lectures and
other instructional materials, are copyrighted materials. Students may not
share outside the class, including uploading, selling or distributing course
content or notes taken during the conduct of the course. Any recording of class
sessions is authorized only for the use of students enrolled in this course
during their enrollment in this course. Recordings and excerpts of recordings
may not be distributed to others.

<P> 

<B>Disruptive, Threatening, or Violent Behavior:</B>
In the classroom and out, students are required to conduct themselves in a
manner that promotes an environment that is safe and conducive to learning and
conducting other university-related business. All incidents and allegations of
violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student will be reported to the ASU
Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students. Such
incidents will be dealt with in accordance with the policies and procedures
described in Section 104-02 of the Student Services Manual, available at
<a href="
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-02.html ">
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-02.html </a>

<P>

<B>Expected classroom behavior:</B> Be sure to arrive on time for class.
Excessive tardiness will be subject to sanctions. If you need to Zoom into

net speed, and mute yourself, but unmute when you need to or are invited to
speak. Under no circumstances should you allow your cell phone to ring during
class. Any disruptive behavior, which includes ringing cell phones, listening

<B>Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation:</B> Title
IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of
sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX
and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on
sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected
to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including
counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone
you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can
find information and resources at
