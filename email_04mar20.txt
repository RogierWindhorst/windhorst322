Hi All:

I sent out this Email via myasu last night, but it didn't go through, so again:

Some of you asked to clarify H/W 5.2, which I have done in the newly posted file
ast322s20_suggestedHWquestions.txt on the URL Links page. A free link to the
PDF file of the Madau paper you need is now also given, so you don't have to
pay for it if you pull it over from home instead of from campus. Keep your
discussion answer and simple, a few paragraphs should suffice. 

Also, the ASU admin has asked me to (verbatim) fwd you the following by Email:

``Dear Students, our class has been selected at random to test Zoom as a
learning tool at ASU. We are going to conduct class today March 5, 2020, on
Zoom. The attached pdf titled ``learning at asu'' provides you instructions of
how to use Zoom. This is the only time we will experiment with Zoom. When you
return from Spring Break, class will return to our normal routine. Thank you
all for assisting the university conduct this test. ''

[File learning_at_asu_using_Zoom.pdf attached and also available at the top of 
the Links page]

Hence, we will teach by Zoom once more today. You may either come to PSF-123,
from where I will run Zoom, but you will have to bring your laptop, IPad or PDA
to run Zoom and follow it, or you may do it from somewhere else but still need 
to Zoom in to get attendance credit. Note we never use Canvas, as it is slow
and unreliable. So only use the Zoom link posted on the Links page of the
class URL windhorst322.asu.edu . Please mute your PDA unless you ask a question.

See you all soon!

Rogier
