How to submit your AST 322 Homework or Term Project </font></font></h3>

<P> <font color="#000000">

Always write your Homework or Term Projects on single sided printed pages with
your name + ASU-ID number and submission date/time written on top. If you met
with your TA in person at ASU, you can hand in your Homework or Term Project in
person at the end of the night. If the TAs permits, you can scan each Homework
or Term Project  into a single PDF file. You can use any ASU library printer to
scan and Email the PDF to you, or you can make a single PDF from your Homework
or Term Project pages that you scan at home with the following app on your PDA: 
<a href="
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner&hl=en_US
">

<font color="#000000"><font size="+0">

<P> 

Unless you could hand-in your Homework or Term Project to your TA in person at
ASU, please submit your Homework or Term Project as following:

<P> 

1) In Canvas, click on Assignments, scroll down to select the module of that
week, and then perform the final upload of your PDF file of the actual Homework
or Term Project. 

<P> 

2) Please do NOT Email your Homework or Term Project PDF files to the TAs or
Instructor Email addresses, since they will also get lost. File formats other
than PDF will not be accepted. Any good Doc file can be simply converted to
PDF. If you have a hard time scanning all you Homework or Term Project pages
into a single PDF file, please check out: 
<a href="
https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/ 
">
this free toolkit to concatenate single-page PDF scans into one PDF file. 
</a> If you cannot produce a PDF file, please contact your TA.

ASU guidelines during and after the COVID19 pandemic </font></font></h3>

<P> <font color="#000000">

COVID-19 campus plans and resources. As the fall 2023 semester begins, we
appreciate your continued efforts to help keep the ASU community safe and
healthy.

<P>

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance note that
vaccination and boosters significantly reduce the risk of severe illness or
death from COVID-19.

<P>

We encourage you to remember these essential COVID-19 prevention tips:

<P>

* COVID-19 is spread person-to-person or by touching contaminated surfaces.
Asymptomatic individuals can spread the disease.

<P>

* Wash your hands frequently and use hand sanitizer when necessary. Clean 
surfaces with disinfectant.

<P>

* Employees who test positive or show symptoms of the virus should stay home
and notify their supervisor.

<P>

* COVID-19 tests are available free of charge. Testing is a critical way to
limit viral spread. COVID-19 tests are available on all ASU campuses for
students, employees and dependents through 
<a href="

">
Devils' drop-off
</a>.

<P>

* COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters are readily available. Follow the
evolving guidance for boosters, particularly those in more vulnerable age groups
and those with other conditions that may increase risk. Learn more about
COVID-19 vaccines on the

areas that are not required. We ask that you respect others' personal
decisions regarding face coverings. 

* ASU continues to monitor health guidance at all campus locations, including
Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and will revise protocols as necessary.
