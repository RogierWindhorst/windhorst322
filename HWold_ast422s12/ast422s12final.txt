                      AST 422 -- Spring 2012 -- FINAL EXAM 

     DUE: May 2, 10:00 am, original in my mailbox in room PSF-686,
     plus xerox in TA's mailbox


       RULES:

IN THE ALLOTTED TIME, PLEASE COMPLETE 6 QUESTIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING FROM THE SET
OF 15 LISTED BELOW. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL TOPICS ARE COVERED FAIRLY, I ASK YOU
THAT YOU SELECT AT LEAST A MINIMUM NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM EACH OF THE THREE
MAIN GROUPS, AS INDICATED BELOW. SO PLEASE READ ALL QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU START.
[E.g., you may select to do all of question A1 in category A, all of B1, B2 
and B3 in category B, and all of C7 and C8 in category C, or any other
permitted combination for a total of 6 questions in categories A, B, C.]

ALL QUESTIONS HAVE EQUAL WEIGHT, TO BE ROUGHLY EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG EACH
OF THE SUB-QUESTIONS. Hence, out of a total of 150 points, each of the 6
questions that you choose will be worth 25 points, and each sub-question
typically 5-8 points (for typically 5-3 sub-questions per question). 

AS ALWAYS: Brevity is as much appreciated as the correct answer. Please do not
give me more than 2-3 pages for each main question, if at all possible. 

NOTE: Ho indicates the current value of the Hubble constant throughout, qo the
current value of the deceleration parameter, Omega0 or Omega_m the current
value of the density parameter, and t0 the current age of the Universe. For
some questions you must assume a cosmology, I suggest we all use Ho=73km/s/Mpc,
Omega_m=0.24, Omega_Lambda=Lambda=0.76, unless given otherwise. In most FRW type 
questions, I will assume Omega_Lambda=0 for simplicity, so the answers can be
found analytically --- in other questions we will use the ``real'' cosmology
Ho=73, Omega_m=0.24, Omega_Lambda=Lambda=0.76. If you don't like solving these 
questions for Omega_Lambda=0, you may solve them for Omega_Lambda=0.76, but then
you have to use the numerical integration path. You may solve the questions for
either Omega_Lambda, but please tell us upfront which Omega_Lambda you have
chosen. 


       GROUP A: SELECT 1--2 QUESTIONS

A-1) Consider the following 5 galaxies: A with v = 5000 km/s at distance R =
100 Mpc; B with v = 10,000 km/s and R = 200 Mpc; C with v = 5000 km/s and R = 50
Mpc; and D with v = 10,000 km/s and R = 100 Mpc; and E at z=1.5 with a measured
age of 3.5--4.0 Gyr at that redshift. 

A-1.a [2 pts] If your Universe only consisted of galaxies A and B, what would
you conclude about the value of the Hubble constant and its error? 

A-1.b [2 pts] If your Universe only consisted of galaxies C and D, what would
you conclude about the value of the Hubble constant and its error? 

A-1.c [3 pts] If your Universe consisted of galaxies A, B, C and D, what would
you derive as the most likely value of the Hubble constant, if you also knew
that the distance measurements to the galaxies were uncertain by at least 35%? 

A-1.d [3 pts] If your Universe consisted of galaxies A, B, C and D, what would
you be able to conclude about large scale motions and about the Hubble expansion
(Ho), if you knew that HST had measured their distances to better than 15%
accuracy? How large could large-scale streaming motions be in such a Universe? 

A-1.e [5 pts] Compute the age of the Universe if Ho=73 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m=0.
Roughly what would this age be for Omega_m=0.24, 1 and 2 (Omega_Lambda=0 in all
cases)? Please sketch the expansion or scale-factor of the Universe as function
of cosmic time for these different values of Omega_m. For which value of
Omega_m do you get the oldest Universe? 

A-1.f [15 pts] Galaxy E is at a redshift z=1.5, where the Universe was only 25%
of its current age (for Omega_m=1, Omega_Lambda=0), and was measured to have a
stellar population age of 3.5--4.0 Gyr at that redshift. Discuss what problems
this poses for certain values of Ho. How does this compare to the globular
cluster age problem (assuming the same values of Ho and Omega_m)? If Omega_m=1,
what values of Ho would be implied by galaxy E? Is this consistent with the
most recent Ho measurements? What other other solutions to this problem can you
think of?


A-2.a Give a brief discussion (telegram style, no more than two pages) about
what the major uncertainties are in determining the Hubble constant. Discuss in
particular how Large Scale Structure can and has affected the value of Ho. 

A-2.b. Out to what distances/on what scales do you know for sure that the
Universe is not homogeneous and isotropic, and at what distances/on what scales
should the Universe be homogeneous and isotropic? Document your answer. 

A-2.c Describe briefly the differences and merits of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
and Hot Dark Matter (HDM) models of galaxy formation. Discuss briefly the major
observational pieces of evidence in favor of/against CDM and in favor of/against
HDM. 


A-3.a Derive from scratch a period - Luminosity relation for Cepheids, using
what you know about stellar structure (polytrope models etc), the stellar
mass-luminosity relation, the relation between bolometric absolute magnitude
and M_V, and the Hertzsprung Russell diagram. Give the relevant intermediate
steps, and derive: 

log P = (0.5 h + 0.3) M_V + (0.5 hd + 0.3d + 3 a) (B-V) + const. 

A-3.b Discuss this result. What does each term mean, and how does it apply to
the distance scale problem?

A-3.c Approximately how is the zero-point in the Cepheid distance scale affected
by dust? How does dust quantitatively affect the zero-point in the Cepheid
distance scale? How do (HST) distance measurements that use Cepheids attempt
to correct for this?

A-3.d Derive for a simply rotating spiral galaxy disk, using Kepler's laws, the
Tully-Fischer relation: Luminosity L proportional to (Delta v)^4, where v in
km/sec. Discuss your assumptions, how does this apply to the distance scale
problem?


A-4) Describe briefly FOUR DIRECT methods for the determination of Ho. Describe
for each method roughly how it works, what the % uncertainties are, and what
the major causes for these uncertainties are. When describing these four
methods, discuss at least the following:

A-4.a) A method based on standard candles.

A-4.b) A method based on standard rods.

A-4.c) A method based on a physical model of hot gases.

A-4.d) A method based on the effects of large masses on the path of light rays.


A-5) Describe how the determination of the Hubble constant may be affected by:

A-5.a The Malmquist bias. You may assume a Schechter or a Gaussian galaxy LF.

A-5.b Significant Large Scale Structure in the direction in which you are
measuring Ho.

A-5.c Significant large scale streaming motions (or a ``Great Attractor'') in the
galaxy distribution. 


A-6: Define a problem of your choosing in nearby extragalactic astronomy and
cosmology (topics: distance scale, large scale structure, etc.), and solve it.
You will be graded on this question for how well you pose the problem (25%), how
relevant it is to cosmology (25%), and how well you solve it (50%). 



       GROUP B: SELECT 2--3 QUESTIONS


B-1.a Show that for all world models with Omega_Lambda=0, we have essentially
qo=1/2 or Omega_m=1 shortly after creation, i.e. when R(t) --> 0 for t --> 0.
Show that this is the case NOT ONLY for k=0, but also for k=-1 and k=+1.
Discuss the relevance of this result. (You may assume reasonable results from
previous homework questions. HINT: this issue is related to the flatness
problem in inflation). 

B-1.b Sketch the look-back time tau(z) for Omega_m=0, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0. 

B-1.c Show that the Age of the Universe t0 = 1.0 / Ho for Omega_m=0.0 
                                        t0 = 2/3 / Ho for Omega_m=1.0
                                        t0 = 0.577/Ho for Omega_m=2.0
assuming Omega_Lambda=0 in all cases for simplicity.


B-2.a Assume that the cosmic time can be parametrized as function of the
``epicyclic'' angle Theta, which is a monotonic function of cosmic time, and
assume that:
COS(Theta0) = (2 - Omega_m)/Omega_m
COS(Theta1) = (z + COS(Theta0))/(1+z),

where COS==cosine for k=+1 (Omega_m=2 or qo=1; Omega_Lambda=0) and ==cosh for
k=-1 (Omega_m=0 or qo=0; Omega_Lambda=0). Show that the look-back time as
function of the total age of the Universe can be written as: 

tau(z)/t0 = 1 - [ (Theta1 - sin(Theta1)) / (Theta0 - sin(Theta0)) ] for k=+1
tau(z)/t0 = 1 - [ (sinh(Theta1) - Theta1)/ (sinh(Theta0) - Theta0)] for k=-1,

and derive the product t0 x Ho in both cases. 

B-2.b For general values of Omega_m or qo, show that the look-back time as
function of redshift can be written as: 

tau(z)=qo/[Ho (2qo-1)^3/2]x[Theta0-Theta1 + sin (Theta1)-sin (Theta0)] for k=+1
tau(z)=qo/[Ho (1-2qo)^3/2]x[Theta1-Theta0 + sinh(Theta0)-sinh(Theta1)] for k=-1

B-2.c Derive the special cases tau(z) = 2/3Ho [(1+z)^3/2 - 1]/[(1+z)^3/2] for
Omega_m=1 or qo=1/2 (assuming Omega_Lambda=0) and tau(z) = z/[Ho (1+z)] for
Omega_m=0 or qo=0 (assuming Omega_Lambda=0). Sketch tau(z) for relevant values
of Omega_m in the range Omega_m=0--2 (or qo=0--1).


B-3.a Using the Mattig equation, show that the observed angular size Theta (in
arcsec) of an object of physical size Y (in kpc) at redshift z goes as:

Theta = k Y (1+z) / (Ro r)

where (Ro r) is the distance of the object as seen by the observer, and k is
some arbitrary constant. 

B-3.b Express Theta in units of (Y Ho/c) as a function of redshift z for the
case Omega_m=0 or qo=0 and the case Omega_m=1 or qo=0.5 (assuming
Omega_Lambda=0 in both cases).

B-3.c Sketch Theta(z) for the cases Omega_m=0, 1 and 2 (or qo=0, 0.5, and 1),
and determine for Omega_m=0 and 1 (or qo=0 and qo=0.5) the value of the
redshift at which Theta will appear the smallest (assuming Omega_Lambda=0 in all
cases). 

B-3.d What is the physical size scale of a CBR fluctuation of 10' diameter at
z=1100 for Omega_m=0, 1 and 2 (pr qo=0, 0.5, and 1; Omega_Lambda=0 in all
cases)?  What is it for the cosmology Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_Lambda=0.7? At what
angular scales do you expect the next generation of microwave satellites 
PLANCK to see most structure in the CBR, in terms of Delta_T/T? Document
your answer. 


B-4) In all of the following sub-questions, make drawings of the run of the
relevant parameter with redshift for various values of Omega_m=0--2 (or qo=0--1;
assuming Omega_Lambda=0) and discuss the results. If you wish, you may do this
for the more complicated case of Omega_m+Omega_Lambda=1 for various values of
Omega_m.  Where necessary, you may assume that objects have a power-law
spectrum with spectral index alpha. 

B-4.a Discuss how the luminosity distance depends on redshift. 

B-4.b Discuss how the volume element available per unit redshift depends on
redshift. Discuss at least two reasons why there may be a decline in the 
observed quasar and young galaxy density for z>2--3. 

B-4.c Discuss how the observed integrated bolometric and monochromatic flux of
an object of fixed standard spectrum depends on redshift. 

B-4.d Discuss how the observed bolometric and monochromatic surface brightness
of an object of fixed standard spectrum depends on redshift. 

B-4.e Discuss how the angular size of an object of fixed metric linear size
depends on redshift. 


B-5.a Show why the matter density in the post-recombination Universe scales as
(1+z)^3, and why the radiation density has scaled since then -- and even before
then -- as (1+z)^4. What does this mean for the shape of the Cosmic Background
Radiation spectrum and for the CBR temperature as function of (1+z)? 

B-5.b Show qualitatively (i.e. never mind the exact physical constants) why the
Jeans mass of a spherical clouds of hot matter goes as T^-3 before
recombination, and as T^3/2 after recombination. Discuss what -- as a
consequence -- the typical masses are of gas clouds that first fragment into
stars or groupings of stars in the early Universe. 

B-5.c Discuss briefly why the faint galaxy two-point correlation function has an
amplitude that is so low. What does this tell you about the redshift
distribution of the faint blue galaxy population and about the clustering of
faint galaxies (and its evolution, or lack thereof). 


B-6.a: A light source in a flat universe has a redshift z when observed at a
time t_0. Show that the observed redshift changes with time at a rate of:

dz/dt_0  =  H_o (1+z) -  H_o (1+z)^[3(1+w)/2]

where w = 0 for matter+vacuum-energy dominated universes (you may assume w=0). 
For what values of w does the redshift decrease with time? For what values of
w does the redshift increase with time?

B-6.b: Suppose you are in a flat, matter-only universe that has a Hubble
constant Ho=73 km/sec/Mpc. You observe a galaxy wth redshift z=1.000000. How
long will you have to be observing this galaxy from Earth to see its redshifts
change by one part in 10^6 ? [Use th results from 6.a]


B-7: Define a problem of your choosing in cosmology and the early universe 
(topics: expansion, FRW models, geometry, observational distinction between the
various cosmological models, etc), and solve it. You will be graded on this
question for how well you pose the problem (25%), how relevant it is to
cosmology (25%), and how well you solve it (50%). 



       GROUP C: SELECT 2--3 QUESTIONS


C-1.a For a population of cosmic radio sources emitting radiation with an
assumed constant luminosity or radio power P (in W/Hz) and constant space
density (in No/Mpc^3), derive for the Euclidean case the source count N(S),
where N is the number of sources (per ster rad) with observed flux density
greater than some value S (measured in Jy=10^-26 W/Hz/m^2). 

C-1.b What is the logarithmic slope of the source counts in flux units (S), and
in magnitude units [m = -2.5 log10(S) + const] for this Euclidean case? Sketch 
this together the radio source counts observed by Ryle et al. and the optical
galaxy counts by many recent observers. What are the actual observed slopes at
the bright end of the counts in both radio and optical? How do you interpret
the slopes being different from question a? Discuss all possible reasonable
answers. 

C-1.c At approximately what magnitude do the B-band galaxy counts make a
significant change in slope (slope changing from approximately what value to
what other value)? Calculate schematically the contribution of each magnitude
bin of the B-band galaxy counts to the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) for
10<B<30 mag. At which magnitude do the B-band galaxy counts contribute maximally
to the EBL? How can this be interpreted in terms of their redshift distribution,
and what does this imply for galaxy formation/evolution scenarios? 


C-2.a Discuss why it was -- in hindsight -- not surprising that in the deepest
available HST fields (~50 hr exposures in both HDF's), faint galaxies were seen
down to V,I=30 mag which are generally quite compact, with scale-lengths r_hl =
0.1--0.3". Discuss why the most compact objects are relatively easy to detect
with HST, what observational selection effects have to be overcome, and how
their flux depends on the various factors of (1+z). 

C-2.b The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an instrument currently
planned for launch in 2015. It will have an 6.5 meter (segmented mirror) and a
rich array of optical and infrared camera's and spectrographs. Estimate how
faint this telescope can see in a 1000 hr exposure (Hint: compare to what the
2.4 meter HST can do with its 100 hr exposures in the HUDF in the BViz filters). 

C-2.c Assume the IR detectors are good enough that similar sensitivities can be
obtained in the near-IR JHK bands. For Ho=73 and Omega_m=0.24, compute out to
which redshift this telescope can see AGN (M_V=-25 and r_hl<0.1 pc), L* galaxies
(M_V=-22 and r_hl=5 kpc), sub-galactic objects (M_V=-17 and r_hl=0.1 kpc),
supernovae (M_V=-19), and globular clusters (M_V=-10 and r_hl=1 pc). Assume 
for simplicity that all these objects are young and therefore blue with flat 
power-law spectra (alpha=0 or 1), so that K-corrections are straightforward. 
[Note: You need to get the answer to question b right to answer c correctly.]

C-2.d What are likely the only objects that the NGST will be able to see at
z>10? Argue your answer and mention at least two reasons why this category of
object is favored above all the others. (You may assume that AGN form after at
least one galactic free fall time has passed). 


C-3.a Consider a stellar population of 10^10 Msun in total, all born at the same
time in the very early history of a galaxy, and following a Salpeter IMF
between 0.08 M_sun<M<100 M_sun -- with no stars forming outside this range.
Roughly how large a fraction of the stars in this galaxy will go off in
Supernovae? How many stars is this? How often do they go off as SNe? 

C-3.b Roughly when did this Supernovae phase happen during the evolution of the
galaxy? What redshift range does this roughly correspond to, if the entire
galaxy formed within one free fall time after the Big Bang? 

C-3.c Sketch qualitatively how the various stellar populations that develop in
the HR diagram (i.e. the MS, RGB, HB, AGB, P-AGB, etc) during the evolution of
this galaxy contribute to its total galaxy light in the Johnson filters
UBVRI+JHK, as well as in the far UV (around 1500 and 2500 A). Briefly discuss
which component dominates each filter and why. 

C-3.d Compute the probability that this galaxy is seen with a supernovae, if it
were discovered at very high redshift by the HST or NGST. [You need to know the
answer to question a and b to answer d]. 


C-4.a Discuss briefly how the integrated optical/near-IR spectra of galaxies
depend on the age of their dominant stellar population. Make a schematic drawing
of their spectra. How does this affect the K-correction we derive for such
galaxies?

C-4.b Discuss briefly how the integrated optical/near-IR spectra of galaxies
depend on the past star-formation history. Make a schematic drawing of their
spectra for various assumed (cartoon-like) star-formation histories. 

C-4.c Discuss how the answers of questions a and b are connected: what is the
physical cause for this connection? How can we best measure galaxy ages?


C-5.a Sketch and discuss how the galaxy counts determined as function of Hubble
type enable us to constrain the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and its
evolution with cosmic epoch.

C-5.b What is the major uncertainty in these exercises? How can we break this
degeneracy by measuring the redshifts or the redshift distribution of faint
galaxies? 

C-5.c Discuss evidence in favor of, and evidence against the premise that 
faint blue galaxies are primarily lower-luminosity (i.e. L<L* in the LF)
objects of irregular morphology and with sizes typically smaller than those of
NGC galaxies seen today. What does this mean for the formation scenario of
galaxies? 


C-6: You observe a quasar at a redshift of z=5.0 and determine that the observed
light flux from the quasar varies on a timescale delta(t_o) = 3 days. If the
observed variation in flux is due to a variation in the intrinsic luminosity of
the quasar, what was the variation timescale delta(t_e) at the time the light
was emitted? For the light of the quasar to vary on a timescale delta(t_e), the
bulk of the quasar light must come from a region of physical size R=<R_max = 
c.delta(t_e) . What is the angular size of R_max in the standard model? How
would you go about observing this?


C-7. In a flat Universe with Ho=73 km/s/Mpc, you observe a galaxy at a z=6. 

C-7.a What is the current proper distance to the galaxy, d_p(t_0), if the
universe only contains radiation?

C-7.b What is d_p(t_0) if the Universe only contains matter?

C-7.c What is d_p(t_0) if the Universe only contains a cosmological constant?

C-7.d What was the proper distance at the time the light was emitted, 
d_p(t_e), if the universe only contains radiation?

C-7.e What was the proper distance at the time the light was emitted, 
d_p(t_e), if the universe only contains matter?

C-7.f What was the proper distance at the time the light was emitted, 
d_p(t_e), if the universe only contains a cosmological constant?


C-8 The surface brightness SB of an astronomical object is defined as its
observed flux divided by its angular area: SB = f/(delta theta)^2. 

C-8.a For a class of objects that are both standard candles and standard
yardstick, what is SB as a function of redshift in the case z<<1?

C-8.b For a class of objects that are both standard candles and standard
yardstick, what is SB as a function of redshift in the case z>>1?

C-8.c Would the SB of this class of object be useful way of determining the
deceleration parameter qo? Why or why not?

C-8.d Discuss the grave cosmological consequences of your answer in C-8.b. Why
do you think observations with HST at z>>5 are so hard? What do you think
objects that JWST will see at z=15 will look like to this telescope --- resolved
or unresolved? Document your answer carefully.


C-9: Define a problem of your choosing in galaxy formation and evolution
(topics: galaxy formation, galaxy evolution, AGN evolution, structure
formation, clustering evolution, the Intergalactic Medium etc), and solve it.
You will be graded on this question for how well you pose the problem (25%),
how relevant it is to cosmology (25%), and how well you solve it (50%).
