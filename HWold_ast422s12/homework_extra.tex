{\small \emph{AST 422 Spring 2007}}\\

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent Calculate the value of $\Delta \rho$$/$$<$$\rho$$>$ for 
different scales given in the Ryden Fig 2.2 on page 10.  The average density
of the universe is: $<$$\rho$$> \sim 10^{-30}$ ($g\,cm^{-3}$). 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] A sphere 3 $m$ in diameter, centered on your navel.\\
You can assume the person has a mass of 80 ($kg$).\\

\item[(b)] A sphere 3 AU in diameter, centered on your navel.\\
The mass included can be estimated as the mass of Earth and the 
mass of the Sun.\\

\item[(c)] A sphere 3 Mpc in diameter, centered on your navel.\\
The mass included can be estimated as the mass of the Milky Way and
the mass of the M31.\\

\item[(\emph{memo})] When you finally increased the diameter to 200 Mpc, 
the density inside becomes the order of the average for the Universe.\\
NO NEED TO SHOW THIS.
\end{itemize}
