Subject: Re: Two more H/W 6 solutions I found

I found a pretty straightforward way of doing it that skirts most of the
difficulty and nasty trig algebra people have been running into.

1. Take derivatives of (5.90) and (5.91) with respect to theta.

2. Substitute both of them into equation (7) from the hints PDF.

3. You now have an expression for da/dt in terms of theta.

4. Substitute this expression into (5.88) in place of adot.

5. Use (5.90) to substitute for a in (5.88).

6. Reduce to something that is trivially true. I got sin^2(theta) = 1 - cos^2(theta).

I didn't even need the trig identities from equations (5) and (6) of the
hints PDF. This strikes me as the best way to go about it.

Rogier, the solutions you sent rely on directly tackling the integral and
using the FullSimplify function in Mathematica.

HINT EMAILED TO THE STUDENTS:

For H/W 6.7a, I recommend this approach:

- Do not try to directly integrate equation (5.89) unless you want to make life
difficult for yourself.

- Use equation (7) from the hints PDF, but don't worry about the trig identities
given in equations (5) and (6).

- Equation (7) will give you da/dt in terms of theta. Focus on showing that this
da/dt and equation (5.90) solve the differential equation (5.88).

- This same approach can also help with H/W 6.7b.

- There are multiple correct ways to complete H/W 6.7--some are easier than
others.

For H/W 6.9:

- When approximating equation (5.110) to get (5.111), keep in mind the Taylor
series approximation sqrt(1+x) ~ 1 +x/2 when x << 1.

- There's a typo in equation (5.111)--the 2 inside the parentheses should be a 3.
