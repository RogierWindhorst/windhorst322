<P> We will make sure that you will all learn the required class materials, and
get your deserved grades despite the pandemic. You will enjoy the AST 322
homework sets and Term Project topics. Special attraction in Spring 2024: since
three Nobel prizes in Physics were given out (in 2017, 2019 and 2020) for the 
topic of Black Holes and Cosmology, respectively, there will be three possible
papers for Term Project topics on Black Holes. (Two other term paper topics
have yet to earn the Nobel prize, so do your very best on that Term Project if
you chose that topic!). Two other possible Term Project topics have also earned
Nobel prizes in the past, so you will work with state-of-the-art materials
whichever Term Project topic you chose. But before you can do so, you will have
to do the 7 H/W sets on the book's chapter 1--6, which will involve some 200
level math. Our purpose of the math is not to annoy you, but to make the
physics that rules the universe understandable. So bear with us, we will try to
it make all as digestible and interesting as possible.
