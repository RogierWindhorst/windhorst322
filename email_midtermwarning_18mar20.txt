Dear :

We are contacting you because we are concerned about your AST 322 grade,
which is currently well below 50%. 

Please contact us during our regular Zoom office hours posted on the
Contacts page on our class URL http://windhorst322.asu.edu/ to discuss
how we can best help you to still succeed.
 
Two of us are also reachable via the cell phone numbers posted there.

Thank you very much,

Rogier Windhorst, Gregory Vance, and Scott Tompkins
